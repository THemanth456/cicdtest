			<h1>Java</h1>

			<p>
				Java has been one of the most
				popular programming language
				for many years. Java is Object
				Oriented. However it is not
				considered as pure object oriented
				as it provides support for primitive
				data types (like int, char, etc) The
				Java codes are first compiled into byte
				code (machine independent code). Then
				the byte code is run on Java Virtual
				Machine (JVM) regardless of the
				underlying architecture.
